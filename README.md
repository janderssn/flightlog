# flightlog
Tool for scraping info from no.flightlog.org  

Main goal is to be able to get info about activity on take off.

Pilots are logging their activity in no.flightlog.org. There is no API for 
reaching det storage behind the web pages so scraping i the only  way to go.

It's also an web app with a simple status view
